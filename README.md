# Gragh_RadioML2018.01A
## Dataset Description

This dataset is derived from **RadioML2018.01A** and introduces a novel method for constructing graph representation learning:

1. **Gradient-Based Structural Mapping**  
   Construct the graph topology based on gradient variations of signal time-domain features, preserving both local abrupt changes and global spatiotemporal trends.
2. **Graph Structure Transformation**  
   A time series gradient-based graph representation is proposed, where each sequence point is modeled as a node with four-dimensional features.
3. **Edge Feature Computation**  
   Dynamically quantify the interaction strength between nodes using a **node interaction force driven by data radiation field** model. This model integrates electromagnetic potential field functions with fuzzy logic, replacing the traditional binary adjacency matrix.
